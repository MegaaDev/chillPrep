    question: "How many questions should we do daily?",

        Honestly, more than the number, the{" "}
        <strong>variety of questions</strong> you solve per day is what really
        matters. Don’t chase the count, focus on the quality time you spend on
        each problem. Try to solve it yourself; if you’re stuck for more than
        20-25 minutes, check the solution and then code it out. Starting with{" "}
        <strong>3–5 questions</strong> per day is great, and as you keep
        prepping, bump it up to <strong>8–10</strong>. Hitting{" "}
        <strong>15+</strong> is a crazy number just before your OTs to brush up
        your concepts.

    question:
      "My friend has already covered so many topics, and I feel behind. What should I do?",
    answer: (
      <>
        It honestly doesn’t matter where you start.{" "}
        <strong>Consistency is the key.</strong> Some people finish the Striver
        sheet before vacations even begin, then slack off later. What counts is
        staying consistent and feeling confident at the end of each day.
        Remember: <strong>DONT SLACK OFF.</strong> Even 1 problem on a light
        day/ occasion keeps your momentum. Don't think about others although a
        healthy competition between your peers is always good, don't get carried
        away by getting stressed due to others. Just{" "}
        <strong>FOCUS on yourself</strong>.

    question: "What about non-DSA prep?",
    answer: (
      <>
        DSA is the top priority for software roles, so spend{" "}
        <strong>80–90%</strong> of your time on it if you already have solid
        projects. Otherwise, parallelize: work on a project and aim to finish it
        within a month so it doesn’t overlap with the last few weeks of prep.
        For non-DSA topics, focus on <strong>OOPS, OS, and DBMS</strong>: about
        maximum an hour per day is usually enough. If you have extra time, dive
        into networking and low-level design.

    question:
      "Which contests should I follow: LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces and other platforms?",
    answer: (
      <>
        I’d suggest mastering <strong>LeetCode contests.</strong> Mastery isn’t
        about solving all four questions, but about confidently solving three
        and understanding the fourth. Contests are like mock tests for JEE,
        essential for timing and adaptability. Do at least one LC contest per
        day; if they start feeling too easy or repetitive, switch to CodeChef or
        Codeforces (These have very interesting problems but yeah the style is
        quite different from LC).

    question:
      "I’ve covered a concept and all its patterns but still don’t feel confident, now what?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Try <strong>CSES problems.</strong> If you think you know a pattern but
        lack confidence, CSES offers tougher problems. I didn’t spend too much
        time there, but I highly recommend it, you’ll end up much more secure on
        that topic.

    question: "How many hours should I study each day?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Don’t obsess over hours. Trust that your consistent grind will pay off.
        While luck plays a huge huge role its not in our hands, doing your part
        with focused effort is what counts. Start with a few hours and a few
        problems, then ramp up as your stamina grows. Sit down and grind as much
        as you can and it is gonna be worth it.
